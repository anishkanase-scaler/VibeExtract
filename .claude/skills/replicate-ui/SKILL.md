name: replicate-ui
description: Automatically replicate a running macOS app's UI as plain HTML+CSS, using VibeExtract's MCP tools (AX tree, self-screenshots, visual diff) plus the Playwright MCP to render and self-verify until the replica visually matches. Use when the user wants to clone/recreate a desktop app screen or window as web UI.
---

# Replicate a desktop UI (perceive → generate → verify loop)

You drive a closed loop: inspect a running macOS app via the **`vibe-extract`** MCP
server, generate plain self-contained **HTML+CSS**, render it with the
**`playwright`** MCP, and visually diff the render against the native original —
iterating until they match.

Both MCP servers must be connected (`claude mcp list`). If `vibe-extract` is
missing, tell the user to open the VibeExtract app and click **Start MCP server**,
then `claude mcp add --transport http vibe-extract <url>`. See
`docs/REPLICATE_UI_PLAYBOOK.md` for full setup.

## The toolkit & where things live (read once)
There is **ONE common toolkit, no per-app code.** It ships *inside this skill* at
`_shared/` (the **Base directory for this skill** shown at the top of this prompt) — so it
travels with the skill on any machine, with or without this repo:
- `role-map.json` + `markup.py` — AX/ARIA role → semantic HTML tag/attrs (`markup.role_el`,
  `markup.el`, `markup.attrs_str`); **`markup.el_from_node(node, …)`** builds an element from an AX
  node AND stamps `data-ax-*` (role/name/bounds/id) so the HTML carries the AX tree (step 6).
- `axtree_view.html` — standalone collapsible viewer for an extraction's `ax_tree.json`; copy it into
  the output dir as `ax_tree.html` (step 10).
- `interactive.css` — the button/input reset + hover/focus/active.
- `sprite.py` (`SpriteSlicer`) + `cache.py` (`SpriteCache`) — crop real pixels into deduped
  icon sprites (for AX / screenshot-only apps); `cache.py` is also the reuse-cache CLI.
- `gridtext.py` (+ `vision_ocr.swift`) — baked grid labels → real text (AX→OCR→repair).
- `resource_extract.py` + `icon_match.py` — **THE icon picker (use this first).** `extract_pool(app)`
  pulls the app's FULL real-icon set (qt `.rcc` / appkit `Assets.car` / electron / loose, auto-dispatch);
  `icon_match.match(native_crop, pool, idx, name_prior=…)` then picks each control's icon by **VISUAL
  silhouette match to the native pixels** (colour-invariant; name map only a prior), and `icon_map.json`
  **LOCKS** confirmed picks so re-runs never regress them. This replaces name-only matching for ALL apps
  (name-matching alone whack-a-moles). See step 3b.
- `catalog_extract.m` + `native_icons.py` — AppKit `Assets.car` extractor (the appkit branch of
  `extract_pool`) + `measure_glyph_box`/`trim`/`key_bg`. `native_icons.name_match` is now just a
  name-PRIOR provider for `icon_match`, not the decider.

Reference it **by the skill's base path**, e.g. `python3 "<skill-base>/_shared/cache.py" …`;
below, `_shared/…` is shorthand for that. **There are no app-specific scripts to locate** — the
method (harvest → inventory → generate → verify) is identical for *every* app; for a given
extraction you generate the HTML directly, or write one **thin throwaway generator** into the
output dir that imports this toolkit.

**Outputs are scratch.** Everything you produce for an extraction — the replica `index.html`,
harvested `assets/`, screenshots/captures, sprite `cache/`, and any generator you write — lives
in **`.replicate-ui/<app>/`** in the current working directory. That folder is gitignored and
fully regenerable: **deleting it loses nothing but caching speed.** The only thing that must
persist is the skill (with its `_shared/`).

## THE METHOD — the canonical pipeline for EVERY app (read this first)
One method, every app — Office, WPS, Slack, Finder, Acrobat, Chess, any macOS app. **No per-app code.**
Four pillars, always in this order; each links to its detailed step below. (Index across sessions:
the master memory `[[replicate-ui-method]]`.)

1. **Icons come from the app's OWN install bundle — never screenshots, never hand-drawn.** Locate the
   install dir (`ps -p <pid> -o comm=` / `mdfind` / `/Applications/<App>.app`) and pull its FULL real-icon
   set with `resource_extract.extract_pool(app_path)` (auto-dispatch: Qt `.rcc` / AppKit `Assets.car` /
   Electron inline-SVG / loose). A screenshot crop is a per-icon LAST RESORT, only for a runtime-rendered
   element with no resource file. → step 3b.
2. **The LLM judges every icon and pixel-matches it to the native reference — then locks it.**
   `icon_match.match(native_crop, pool, idx, name_prior=…, keywords=…)` ranks candidates by a
   colour-invariant silhouette score — the native PIXELS decide, the name map only biases. THEN the
   **LLM vision gate is a REQUIRED step**: view the native crop beside the top-k and confirm each pick
   once by eye (shape + accent colours) — the score narrows but doesn't settle the final look (thin /
   accent-only glyphs stay low-confidence). Lock every confirmed pick in `icon_map.json`
   (`{resource,confirmed,crop_hash}`); re-runs FREEZE locked entries → never re-pick → no regression. → step 3b.
3. **Build the DOM from the AX tree as a real, semantic frontend.** Drive every element from its AX role
   through `markup.el_from_node(node, …)` (single choke point: role→tag via `role-map.json`, stamps
   `data-ax-*`) → semantic tags, REAL focusable controls (`<button>`, `<input>`, `role=tab/slider/combobox`),
   `interactive.css` for focus/hover, laid out as a NESTED normal-flow hierarchy (landmarks + flex/gap/
   margin) that reads like a hand-written app — NOT a flat `position:absolute` div canvas. Use judgment to
   make it look like a real frontend; carets are their OWN focusable elements, never glued into a label.
   Flat absolute-div / sprite clones are the fallback ONLY when the AX tree is opaque (Electron-no-CDP,
   CEF, SceneKit). → step 6.
4. **Consolidate the learnings — load ONE method, not fragments.** Every cross-app law (fresh-crop-only
   pixels, dev-picks-once auto-iteration, per-region acceptance gate, reconstruct-never-image, incremental
   reuse, platform capture gotchas) is indexed from `[[replicate-ui-method]]`; the steps below and the
   deep-dive memories carry the specifics.

Everything after this section is the detailed loop that implements these four pillars.

## The golden rule: coordinates & scale
- All AX bounds and screenshot inputs are in **points**, top-left origin.
- Native screenshots come back at **device pixels** (Retina ≈ 2× points). Each
  `screenshot_*` result includes `px_w`, `px_h`, and `scale` (px/point).
- **Render the replica at the component's POINT size** (CSS px = `point_w × point_h`).
  `compare_images` resizes both sides to a common canvas, so you do **not** need to
  match device pixels — just render at point size and let the diff reconcile scale.

## Loop

1. **Preflight.** Call `check_ax_permission`. If not `trusted`, call
   `request_ax_permission` and tell the user to grant VibeExtract under
   System Settings → Privacy → Accessibility **and** Screen Recording
   (`screencapture` needs the latter or shots come back black). Stop until granted.

2. **Target.** `frontmost_app` (or `list_windows`) to get the target `pid` and the
   window `bounds`. Confirm with the user which window if ambiguous.

2b. **Scope — selection vs whole window.** Call `get_selection`. If `present` is true —
   the user picked component(s) in the desktop app (⌘⇧S on the target app, then click; ⇧+click
   adds more) — and `age_seconds` is recent (under ~600; if older, confirm with the user it's the
   intended pick), switch to **COMPONENT-ONLY mode**: skip the whole-window inventory and replicate
   *just* the selected element(s). For each element, first decide whether to trust its `bounds`:

   **Native reference crop — prefer `crop_path` (healthy picks only).** A *healthy* pick carries
   `crop_path`: a PNG of that element captured AT PICK-TIME (cropped from the owning window, free of
   the pick overlay). It stays valid even if the app has since been **closed or moved to another
   Space**, so use it as the native reference (`compare_images` `a_path`) instead of a live
   `screenshot_region` whenever it's non-null — no need to keep the target app on screen. Fall back to
   `screenshot_region { x,y,w,h }=bounds` only when `crop_path` is null AND the app is still visible.
   For **shallow picks `crop_path` is intentionally null** (the bounds were a click-centered placeholder,
   not the real element) — don't treat that as a capture failure; re-resolve via `extract_component`
   at the click as below (this needs the app still running).

   - **Healthy AX pick** (`ax_shallow` is false **and** role isn't AXMenuBar/AXApplication/AXWindow):
     PREFER the element's stored **`ax_tree`** from `get_selection` for roles/structure — it's the
     pick-time subtree and stays valid even after the app is closed/switched; only if `ax_tree` is
     null fall back to the live `ax_subtree_at_point { x: bounds.x+bounds.w/2, y: bounds.y+bounds.h/2 }`.
     Use the element's `crop_path` (else `screenshot_region { x,y,w,h }`=`bounds`) for the native
     reference, `extract_component { x, y }` for a DOM/CSS head-start.
   - **Shallow AX pick** (`ax_shallow` is true, or role ∈ {AXMenuBar, AXApplication, AXWindow}): the
     native AX tree couldn't see the real element — normal for **Electron** apps (Slack, VS Code),
     whose web content isn't exposed to AX. **Do NOT use `bounds`** (it's a click-centred placeholder,
     not the real element). Instead call `extract_component { x: click.x, y: click.y }` (the full
     CDP→AX→screenshot ladder at the exact click). If it returns **ElectronNeedsRelaunch**, tell the
     user and **offer** `relaunch_with_debug_port { bundle_id, display_name, confirm: true }` (this
     quits & reopens that app — only with their OK), then retry `extract_component` at `click`. Use the
     **returned element's** bounds for `screenshot_region` and for sizing the replica.

   Then Generate (6) + verify (7–9) the component against its crop, sized to its point bounds.
   (Multiple selected elements → compose them.) If `present` is false/empty, proceed with the
   **whole-window** flow below.

2c. **Reuse check — METHOD only, NEVER stale pixels.** 🚫 **THE GOLDEN RULE OF REUSE: the
   CURRENT capture (for a selected component, the pick-time `crop_path`) is the SINGLE source of
   truth for every pixel — colours AND sprites alike. NEVER reuse colours, sprite PNGs,
   `window.png`, or a prior `index.html`'s pixels from an earlier run.** A previous capture can be
   from a different theme/appearance/state — reusing its pixels silently ships the WRONG background
   shade or a stale icon (e.g. a dark Share button, or a `#1b1b1b` fill where the live app is
   `#282828`). The dev must never have to point at a wrong colour or icon. So every run **re-derives
   all pixels from the fresh capture: re-sample EVERY colour and re-slice EVERY sprite from it.**
   Run `python3 "<skill-base>/_shared/cache.py" <app> [win_w win_h]` (app = the working-dir name) to
   see what's cached, but reuse is limited to the **METHOD**, not pixels:
   - ✅ **REUSE — generator script** (`build.py`): the layout structure + per-element coordinate
     map. Re-run it against the FRESH capture so it re-samples colours + re-slices sprites anew.
   - ✅ **REUSE — text fonts** (`assets/fonts/*.woff2`): glyph files don't change page-to-page.
   - ✅ **REUSE — grid-OCR labels** (`capture/headers_cache.json`) ONLY when the capture is
     byte-identical (same mtime) — `gridtext.py` already guards on this.
   - ❌ **DO NOT REUSE — colours / sprite PNGs / `window.png` / prior `index.html` pixels.**
     Re-capture (or use the fresh crop) and regenerate these every run. `cache.py` reports these as
     present for speed context, but they are a *stale-pixel trap* — re-derive, don't copy.
   First page of an app → nothing cached → full cost. Thereafter you save the *method* (no
   re-measuring layout, no re-OCR, no re-harvesting fonts) — but pixels are always fresh.

3. **Inventory.** `ax_tree { pid, window_index: 0 }` → the component tree (roles,
   names, values, per-node `bounds`). This is your structural source of truth — a
   screenshot can't give you roles/labels. For Electron apps the AX tree may be
   shallow; if so, use `extract_component { x, y, pid }` for a high-fidelity
   DOM/CSS head-start (it returns `html`+`toon`), or call
   `relaunch_with_debug_port { bundle_id, display_name, confirm: true }` first
   (this quits & reopens the app — only with the user's OK).

   **SAVE THE AX TREE — it's a deliverable, not scratch.** Write the `ax_tree` result
   verbatim to `.replicate-ui/<app>/ax_tree.json` (pretty JSON). In **component mode**
   (2b), the per-element **`ax_tree`** returned by `get_selection` is ALREADY the pick-time subtree —
   write THAT to `ax_tree.json` (no separate `ax_subtree_at_point` call needed unless it's null).
   This file is the **canonical
   semantic spec** of the UI (every control's role/name/value/bounds/children); the
   replica's HTML carries the same data inline (step 6), and `ax_tree.html` (step 10)
   renders it. (No AX tree for pure-CDP/Electron captures — that's honest; don't fake one.)

3b. **Harvest real assets — ALWAYS (do this every run).** 🚫 **Real assets are mandatory.
   NEVER hand-draw, approximate, or substitute an icon, image, avatar, or font.** Every one of
   them in the replica MUST come from a harvest (`extract_assets`) or the reuse cache — this is
   not optional and not something to defer or "fix later." Hand-drawn SVGs are the #1 cause of a
   replica that looks wrong; the user should never have to point one out. So:
   - **Run `extract_assets { }` on every run** (it reads the LIVE renderer, so it's never stale).
     Per step 2c, reuse only the cached **fonts** (`assets/fonts/*.woff2`) verbatim; re-derive
     **icons/SVGs/images** from this run's harvest, not a prior run's pixels.
   - If the target is **Electron without a debug port**, *offer* `relaunch_with_debug_port` to
     enable the harvest — do **not** fall back to drawing.
   - **DEFAULT per-icon sequence — do ALL of this on the FIRST pass (don't wait for the dev to flag a
     wrong icon):** (1) resolve the resource (`.kui`/pool + `icon_match.match` visual prior); (2)
     **recolour by CLASS ROLE** via `icon_theme.recolor_svg` — body→native grey, named-accent→accent,
     NEVER one-colour-per-icon; (3) **SAMPLE** the body grey + each accent from the fresh native crop and
     bake them (dark accents are softer than kd defaults); (4) run the **icon gate** (step 8b) and
     auto-iterate until clean. Getting (2)+(3) right on attempt 1 is what makes the first render correct.
   - **Icon selection is VISUAL-MATCH-DRIVEN + LOCKED (use `icon_match`; name-matching alone
     whack-a-moles).** Pipeline: `resource_extract.extract_pool(app_path)` → the app's full real-icon
     pool; then per control `icon_match.match(native_crop, pool, idx, name_prior=<.kui/AX/data-qa>,
     keywords=[…])` ranks candidates by **colour-invariant silhouette score** — the native PIXELS decide,
     the name map only shortlists/biases (a clearly-better visual match wins). The model **confirms each
     pick once** (native-vs-top-k grid) and it's **locked in `icon_map.json`** (`{resource,confirmed,
     crop_hash}`); re-runs FREEZE locked entries → never re-pick → **no regression** (the root cause of
     "fixed one, broke another" was global re-picking with no lock). Notes: render candidate masks via
     BATCHED `qlmanage` (use luma, not alpha — qlmanage paints an opaque white bg); CAP the keyword
     shortlist (substring `"line"` → 1000+ candidates). Thin/accent-only glyphs stay low-confidence → the
     model's eye on the top-k. This is HOW you pick from the real resources below:
   - **For ANY native app (no CDP — Office, Finder, WPS, Mail, System Settings…) the icons are REAL
     resource files inside the app's INSTALL BUNDLE. Extract those. A screenshot crop is a LAST
     RESORT, never the default.** 🚫 Do NOT screenshot-crop an icon when its real file exists — a
     scaled screenshot crop is small/blurry/dim and bakes in the background (this was a flagged
     mistake). For a NEW app, FIRST find where it's installed (`ps -p <pid> -o comm=` /
     `mdfind`/`/Applications/<App>.app`); its icons live under one resource tree. Check, in order:
       • **AppKit** (Office, Finder, Apple apps): compiled catalog **`Assets.car`** via
         `_shared/native_icons.py`+`catalog_extract`: `find_catalogs(app_path)`→`build_pool(car,out)`→
         `load_pool(out,"normal_dark"|"normal")`. `name_match(ax_name,pool,extra=[catalog name])` supplies
         only the NAME PRIOR — `icon_match` still DECIDES by pixels (pillar 2); this holds for AppKit too.
       • **Qt / Kingsoft / cross-platform (WPS & many others): Qt resource bundles `*.rcc`/`*.qrc`**
         (e.g. WPS `…/Contents/Resources/office6/mui/default/prometheus_kso_res.rcc`,
         `…/skins/<active-theme>/default/*.rcc`). Parse the `qres` format directly: header magic
         `qres`, u32 version/tree_off/data_off/name_off; v2 = fixed 22-byte tree nodes (name u32, flags
         u16[1=zlib,2=dir]; dir→child_count/child_idx; file→…/data_off u32 @+10; +u64 mtime); names
         `[u16 len][u32 hash][utf-16BE]`; data `[u32 len][bytes]` (usually UNCOMPRESSED svg/png; zlib via
         `zlib.decompress(b[4:])` iff flag&1). Walk tree→`{path:bytes}`, match the command name
         (`/icons_svg/24x24/FormatPainter.svg`,`Shapes.svg`,`Fill.svg`,`OutLine.svg`,`ShapeEffect.svg`,
         `Group.svg`,`BringForward.svg`,`SelectObjects.svg`…).
       • **Loose files**: `Contents/Resources/**` png/svg/`.icns` dirs, theme/skin folders.
     **Prefer SVG** (vector → crisp at the measured size). Theme-aware vectors keep the glyph in a
     `<style>` whose **BODY** class is theme-following (`kd-color-icon-primary` / `.colorBlackStroke` /
     `var(--kd-color-icon-primary,#333333)`) and whose **ACCENT** lives in a sibling NAMED class
     (`kd-color-icon-blue-primary`, `.colorOrangeStroke #DC5513`). 🚫 **NEVER recolour with ONE colour
     per icon** — that paints the BODY in the accent colour (a fully-blue document instead of grey-doc +
     blue badge). It's invisible on monochrome icons and only bites accented ones, so it hides until you
     eyeball them (this was a real regression on PDF→Word/Excel/PPT/Picture-to-PDF). Use the canonical
     **`_shared/icon_theme.recolor_svg(svg, body_hex, accents=…)`**: BODY classes → the native dark-mode
     grey (SAMPLE it, ≈`#c7c7c7`), each NAMED-accent class → its native-SAMPLED accent (dark-theme accents
     are SOFTER than the kd light defaults — e.g. blue `#558fec` not `#3a82f7`; sample, don't assume).
     Colours MUST be baked (an `<img src>` SVG can't inherit; qlmanage/Chromium ignore CSS vars). Run the
     recolour at BUILD time so no icon can ship mis-coloured. Place each icon at its **measured glyph box** (step 6).
   - 🚦 **MANDATORY colour-aware icon gate — don't stop until it passes.** The silhouette-mask scorer is
     COLOUR-BLIND and whole-strip SSIM is alignment-dominated — BOTH miss a wrong body colour or wrong
     accent. After placing icons, run **`_shared/icon_match.gate_icon(native_crop, replica_crop)`** per
     icon: it scores shape AND samples body+accent on BOTH sides (≤~24/ch). Template-locate each native
     glyph by sliding the (clean) replica glyph over a generous window — NEVER trust a fixed box (it
     catches label text: "Pic"/"Extr"/"Sc"). Re-pick/recolour every failure and re-run until each icon
     matches in shape AND colour. This is the *separate icon accuracy predictor*; a low whole-strip SSIM
     is never an excuse to ship a wrong icon.
   - **Screenshot-crop = per-icon LAST RESORT**, only when an element genuinely has NO resource file —
     a *runtime-rendered/dynamic* preview (WPS's "Abc" shape-style thumbnails, a slide thumbnail, an
     avatar). Then crop the real pixels (`key_bg`/transparent-key) — never hand-draw — and SAY in the
     report that you cropped it and why no resource existed. Icon-font apps: read the codepoint + embed
     the harvested woff2.

   On the harvest itself: `extract_assets { }` pulls assets straight from the live renderer via CDP
   (works even when the app isn't frontmost). It writes files under
   `<out>/assets/{fonts,img}` and returns a manifest:
   - `fonts[]` — every `@font-face` woff2 (icon fonts **and** text fonts, e.g.
     Slack's `Slack-Lato-Quip`), saved locally.
   - `icons[]` — `className → codepoint` for icon-**font** glyphs (apps that use
     an icon font), with each glyph's accessible `label`.
   - `svgIcons[]` — for apps that render icons as **inline SVG** (modern Slack:
     ~50 icons named by `data-qa`, e.g. `home-filled`, `search`, `send-filled`),
     the exact SVG written to `assets/icons/<name>.svg` plus its computed `color`.
   - `images[]` — every visible `<img>`/background (avatars, uploaded files,
     workspace icon) saved to `assets/img/<label>.png`, read in-page when CORS
     allows, else captured pixel-perfect via a `Page.captureScreenshot` clip.
   Map each asset to your replica by its `label`/`name` (icons) and by identity
   (images). Inline SVGs use `fill="currentColor"` — inline them and set the
   wrapper `color` to the captured value; size them with your container's
   `svg{width:Npx}` rule (do **not** force `width:100%`, which blows up unsized
   buttons). Keep text on a calibrated stack (the local text font is identical to
   the system one but can re-drift hand-tuned spacing — verify after swapping).

4. **Reference shots.** `screenshot_window { pid }` for the whole window, and
   `screenshot_region { x,y,w,h }` per component (use each node's `bounds`). Each
   returns an inline image (look at it) **and** a saved `path` (use that for diffing).
   Note the `scale`.

5. **Decompose.** Split the window into its top-level AX regions (title bar,
   sidebar, toolbar, content). Replicate and verify each **independently** against
   its native crop, then compose into one document and verify the whole window.

6. **Generate.** Write plain, self-contained **HTML+CSS** (no framework, no build
   step) to a working dir, sized to the component's **point** dimensions. Use the
   AX inventory for structure/text and the reference shot for colors, spacing, and fonts.
   **🔑 Single pixel source:** sample EVERY colour and slice EVERY sprite from the **same current
   capture you will diff against** — for a selected component that is the pick-time `crop_path`
   (set the generator's source image to the crop *before* any sampling/slicing). NEVER read a
   colour from a cached constant or an older capture; that's the `#1b1b1b→#282828` stale-bg trap.
   If you reuse a prior generator (step 2c), confirm its `C_*` colour samples and sprite slices
   read from THIS run's image, not the one baked at its last run.
   **Sample colors with `sample_color` at MULTIPLE points — don't assume one flat fill.**
   Backgrounds vary: a title-bar strip, a header band, and the body can be different shades
   (e.g. Slack's lighter title bar over a darker aubergine body) — sample each region; guessing
   a single bg color is a common, visible miss. **Sample the fill that shows in the GAPS between
   icons too** (the container background) — that's the one that bit us as a too-dark ribbon.
   For **icons and images**, drop in the real assets from step 3b (inline the harvested SVGs /
   reference the saved PNGs + woff2). 🚫 **NEVER hand-draw an icon. If you find yourself about to
   write an SVG path from scratch, STOP and harvest or crop the real one** (step 3b's exact-icon
   fallback) — a hand-drawn approximation is never acceptable, even for a "simple" glyph. A tiny
   generator script that reads the manifest and substitutes assets by name keeps this repeatable.

   **Emit SEMANTIC, interactive markup — never one flat image or all `<div>`s.**
   Every control is an *individual, real, focusable element* chosen by its
   accessibility **role**, mapped through the shared, platform-agnostic
   `_shared/role-map.json` (via `_shared/markup.py`'s `role_el`/`el`; AX roles *and* ARIA/DOM roles → tag):
   `AXButton`/`AXMenuButton`/`AXCheckBox` → `<button>` (with `aria-haspopup` /
   `aria-pressed`); a radio in a tab group → `<button role="tab" aria-selected>`;
   `AXComboBox` → `role="combobox"` + `<input>`; `AXTextField`/`AXSearchField` →
   `<input type=text|search>`; `AXSlider` → `role="slider"`; `AXStaticText` →
   `<span>`. The icon artwork (sprite PNG for AX apps, inline SVG for Electron)
   goes **inside** the real control. Inline `_shared/interactive.css`
   for the button/input reset (so wrapping is a pixel no-op) + hover/focus/active.
   This is **platform-agnostic** — drive it from the role, never special-case per
   app. Static clone: set `aria-selected`/`aria-pressed` at build time; no JS.

   **Stamp the AX tree onto the markup (`data-ax-*`).** Every element you emit from an AX node
   must carry its semantics inline: `data-ax-role`, `data-ax-name`, `data-ax-bounds` (+
   `data-ax-id` / `data-ax-value` / `data-ax-subrole` when present). Don't hand-write these —
   build the element with **`markup.el_from_node(node, inner=…, cls=…, style=…)`** (the single
   choke point: it stamps `data-ax-*` then maps role→tag via `role-map.json`). This makes the HTML
   self-describing (the *code* contains the AX tree, matching `ax_tree.json`) and lets a viewer
   overlay/inspect controls. The bar: every node-derived element carries `data-ax-*`.

   **Native-app pixel-perfect rules (learned from Office ribbons — apply every time, no prompting):**
   - **Measured glyph box, NEVER a fixed square.** Place each icon at the exact (x,y,w,h) measured
     from the native crop (`native_icons.measure_glyph_box`), not a hardcoded 32×32. Native glyphs
     vary in size/aspect (e.g. a wide ~39×28 Margins icon); forcing a square mis-sizes + shifts the
     whole row — this was THE layout-broken root cause. (Screenshot sprites never had it because the
     sprite *was* the exact pixel block at the exact position.)
   - **Crisp, not thick:** use the LARGEST catalog rendition and downscale to the measured box; never
     upscale a small rendition (→ blurry/thick strokes).
   - **Dropdown indicators from the AX role — and there are TWO kinds, don't conflate them:**
     • `AXMenuButton`/`AXComboBox` → a **single** down caret `⌄` (`native_icons.caret_for`), to the
       RIGHT of the icon (tall buttons) or after the label (row buttons).
     • `AXPopUpButton` (a value box like Word's citation **Style: [APA]**) → an **up/down double
       chevron** `⌃⌄` on the right INSIDE the box (`native_icons.popup_spinner()`), NOT a single caret.
     • `AXButton`/`AXCheckBox` → NONE. Never guess.
     • **A caret is its OWN element, NEVER a character glued into the label string.** Emit it as a
       separate clickable/focusable component — `<span class="caret" role="button" aria-haspopup="menu"
       data-ax-role="AXMenuButton" tabindex="0">⌄</span>` (like Excel's separate `caretbtn`) — so it is
       an individual control, not text. Writing `f"{label} ⌄"` is WRONG (flagged by the dev). The split
       button itself carries `aria-haspopup`. Inline `_shared/interactive.css` so every `role=button`/
       caret gets cursor/hover/focus. This holds for ALL apps.
   - **Render what the native DRAWS, not the AX name.** A control's AX name is a label, not its visual:
     e.g. the citation-style popup is named `"Style:"` but Word draws the `SelectBibliographyStyle`
     book+brush ICON before the box, with no "Style:" text — so place the icon, not the literal name.
     When AX gives a name that the UI shows as an icon, find + place that icon (catalog or crop).
   - **Verify each icon's GLYPH, not just its position.** A name match can be the right name but the
     WRONG glyph: catalog `InsertCitation` is a page with `(−)`+check, but Mac Word draws a scroll with
     green `+`/red `−`. In the stacked view (step 8) ZOOM into every icon and compare SHAPE + accent
     COLOURS; when the catalog glyph differs from native, force that control to a screenshot **crop**
     (`["CROP"]` sentinel) — the guaranteed-exact fallback. (Automated glyph cross-correlation is too
     noisy to gate on — it scores correct matches as low as wrong ones; rely on the zoomed stacked check.)
   - **Disabled/greyed controls → reduced opacity** (~0.4) when the native shows them dimmed.
   - **Steppers (`AXIncrementor`)** = label + bordered value box (value from the AX `value`) + up/down
     arrows + the small inline indicator icon (crop it from the native). Render **group sub-labels**
     (`AXStaticText`) at their AX positions; align labels + boxes in columns under their header.
   - **Share/accent buttons obey the no-hand-draw rule (3b):** sample the exact fill from the crop +
     use the REAL glyph (`ic_fluent_share` etc.) — wrong twice when drawn (Excel `#3e8745`, Word `#3d6ede`).

   **Lay it out as a NESTED HIERARCHY in NORMAL FLOW — not a flat `position:absolute`
   canvas.** Emit real landmark containers (`<header>`/`<nav>`/`<aside>`/`<main>`/
   `<section>`) and place children with flexbox + normal flow (`display:flex`, `gap`,
   `margin`, `margin-left:auto`, `padding`, `flex` ratios) — *not* per-element
   `left`/`top`. Reserve `position:absolute` for **genuine overlays pinned inside a
   `position:relative` parent** (a presence dot on an avatar corner, a dropdown caret,
   a focus ring) — never as the primary layout mechanism. This holds even when the
   source gives you pixel bounds (AX tree / screenshot): translate those bounds into
   container `padding`/`gap`/`margin` **once**, computed from the measured constants,
   so the markup reads like hand-written code and stays accessible/maintainable. Two
   techniques keep it pixel-exact: **anchor each group/section by its fixed edge**
   (toolbar right-group via `margin-left:auto` + a fixed end-padding; let intra-group
   `gap`s fall inward) and **re-anchor long vertical lists per-section with an explicit
   `margin-top`** (so flex rounding resets per section instead of accumulating).
   Center text with the row container's `align-items:center` + leaf `line-height:1`
   (font-metric-robust; avoids per-element vertical offsets). These techniques are
   **app-agnostic** — a DOM-sourced app (Slack), a screenshot/AX-opaque one (Acrobat), and a
   dense AX one (Excel: nested ribbon groups, a recursive x/y→margin renderer, one A1 overlay)
   all nest + flow through the same `_shared/markup.py` + `role-map.json`. There are **no
   per-app generators to copy**: apply the method here, writing the HTML directly or via one
   throwaway generator in the output dir that imports the toolkit. See the playbook for worked
   patterns.

   **Grid labels (column letters / row numbers / a date strip baked into one image) →
   REAL TEXT, never a sprite.** Use the shared `_shared/gridtext.py` (AX →
   OCR → sequence-repair): detect the range + cell sizes from the capture's gridlines
   (never hardcode the count), get each label from AX if exposed else OCR each cell (macOS
   Vision via `_shared/vision_ocr.swift`) and repair with a `kind` (alpha/numeric) — OCR
   gives the start (scroll-aware), the kind only cleans noise + fills misses. Render real
   `<div>` cells; detect the selected row/col highlight. Reuse across apps; Excel headers
   are the reference. (Real text costs a little SSIM vs the sprite in dense bands — expected.)

7. **Render.** Via the `playwright` MCP:
   - `browser_resize { width: point_w, height: point_h }`
   - `browser_navigate { url: "file:///abs/path/to/replica.html" }` — if this errors with
     "Access to file: protocol is blocked", serve the dir (`python3 -m http.server` in the output
     folder, run in the background) and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/index.html` instead.
   - `browser_take_screenshot { filename: "replica-<component>.png" }` → note the saved path.

8. **Verify — `compare_images` PLUS a STACKED pixel comparison (required; do not skip).**
   `compare_images { a_path: <native crop>, b_path: <replica> }` → read `score` and the red diff
   **heatmap**. THEN also build a **stacked image — native on top, replica directly below at the same
   width — and look at it**, plus **per-region crops** of every busy area (each icon group). **Zoom
   into EVERY icon and compare its GLYPH — shape + accent colours + which dropdown indicator (single
   `⌄` vs up/down `⌃⌄`)** — not just whether something sits in the right place. The stacked view is how
   you actually catch the errors the dev would otherwise flag (wrong icon, wrong glyph under a right
   name, mis-sized icon, single-caret-vs-spinner, AX-name-as-text instead of the drawn icon, misaligned
   label/box) — the number alone won't. When a glyph differs, crop it (`["CROP"]`) and re-verify.
   **Judge LAYOUT by alignment, not the score:** where icons/shapes land ON the native they go
   **dark** in the heatmap = aligned. **SSIM is TEXT-CAPPED:** on label-dense UI (ribbons) real-text
   labels (browser vs native font AA) hold the score ~0.55–0.75 even when the layout is pixel-exact —
   that residual red is *text*, not a defect. So don't chase the number; confirm in the stacked view
   that **icons, colours, chevrons, and positions** all match, region by region.

8a. **PER-REGION ACCEPTANCE GATE (HARD — overrides the SSIM stop).** The stacked/zoom check above is
   NOT advisory. Before any region is "done" it must pass all three *sampled* checks. "SSIM is
   text-capped / diminishing returns" (step 9) is a stop ONLY for residual **text** antialiasing — it
   NEVER excuses a size, colour, or decoration defect. For EVERY control in the region:
   1. **Icon size — measured, not fixed.** Each icon's box comes from `native_icons.measure_glyph_box`
      (or an equal bright-pixel tight bbox); tight-crop/trim so the glyph FILLS its box (a padded crop
      shrinks+dims the glyph under `object-fit:contain`; a real SVG must be sized to the measured glyph,
      not its padded viewBox). Re-measure the glyph in the REPLICA render; it must match native within
      **±2-3px** in w and h. A fixed-size, padded, or wrong-coloured (invisible→tiny) icon is a FAIL.
   2. **Colour parity — sample BOTH sides.** `sample_color` the SAME point on the native crop AND the
      replica render for every label, fill (incl. gap/container bg), colour-indicator bar, border, and
      selection/active state; assert per-channel |Δ| ≤ **12**; record native-vs-replica hex. Over
      tolerance ⇒ fix the sampled constant (don't eyeball) ⇒ FAIL. (Tip: small text on a dark bg
      renders dim under `-webkit-font-smoothing:antialiased`; drop it to match native brightness.)
   3. **Decoration enumeration.** List EVERY decoration native draws (underlines, *bordered* colour
      bars, selection borders, chevrons `⌄` vs `⌃⌄`, dividers, badges) and confirm each is reproduced
      (present, placed, colour within ±12). A native decoration with no replica counterpart is a FAIL.
   Report per region: icons measured (max px Δ), colour samples (count, max channel Δ), decorations
   (found / reproduced). Only after all three pass for every region do step 9's stop criteria apply.

8b. **ICON ACCEPTANCE GATE (HARD + RUNNABLE — the icon part of "done").** Icons are where "looks fine"
   repeatedly shipped wrong, so this is not judgment — it's a command you MUST run and show. Your
   generator emits **`icon_boxes.json`** (`{name:[x,y,w,h]}` — each icon's box in the render; you know
   every position) and renders the replica at the native region's point size, then runs
   **`python3 "<skill-base>/_shared/icon_gate.py" <native>.png <replica>.png icon_boxes.json`** (wire it
   as the LAST step of the build so it can't be skipped — see `.replicate-ui/wps/build_tools.py`). The
   gate template-LOCATES each native glyph (slides the clean replica glyph — never a fixed box, which
   catches label text), compares shape + body/accent colour, writes a native|replica **contact sheet**
   (`_icon_gate.png`), and exits: **0** all PASS · **1** a gross colour FAIL (fix + rebuild) · **2** some
   EYEBALL (low-confidence localize / low shape / thin glyph). 🚦 **You may only treat icons as done when
   the gate is exit 0, OR exit 2 with EVERY `EYEBALL` tile confirmed identical by your own eye on the
   contact sheet.** A `FAIL` is never "done"; an unreviewed `EYEBALL` is never "done". (The gate is
   deliberately conservative on tiny AA'd glyphs — colour metrics are noisy, so it hard-fails only gross
   errors and routes the rest to your eye; the recolour step in 3b is what makes the FIRST render correct.)

9. **Iterate — YOURSELF, to the bar. The dev picks once and never iterates.** If `pass` is false
   (score < 0.92): inspect the heatmap, fix the HTML/CSS for the highlighted regions, re-render,
   re-diff. **Run EVERY iteration autonomously** — re-sampling colours, re-slicing sprites, and
   nudging alignment are all YOUR job, done from the crop you already have. 🚫 **NEVER stop at a low
   score to hand the loop back to the dev, and NEVER ask the dev to do something the crop already
   enables** (bring the app forward, confirm a colour, pick again). The dev performed exactly one
   action — the pick — and is owed the finished, verified component. With pixels sampled fresh from
   the crop (step 6), the first render is already close, so this is a few quiet internal rounds, not
   a dev round-trip. Stop when:
   - `score ≥ 0.92` (pass), **or**
   - **6 iterations** on this component, **or**
   - two consecutive iterations improve `score` by **< 0.005** (diminishing returns).
   - **Gate precondition:** none of these stops apply until **8a passes** for the region — a
     size/colour/decoration FAIL is never "diminishing returns" or "text-capped."
   Report the final score per component; never silently accept a low score — but reaching the stop
   condition is YOUR call to make and report, not a question to bounce to the dev.

10. **Compose & final-verify.** Assemble verified components into the full page at
    the window's point size, render, and `compare_images` against the
    `screenshot_window` shot. Report the final whole-window score and write the
    final `index.html`. **Then make the folder a complete spec:** ensure
    `ax_tree.json` is present (step 3) and copy `_shared/axtree_view.html` →
    `.replicate-ui/<app>/ax_tree.html` (it loads `ax_tree.json` and renders the
    collapsible tree). Deliverable = `index.html` (visual + `data-ax-*`) +
    `ax_tree.json` (canonical spec) + `ax_tree.html` (viewer).

    **Show it IN THE APP, not at a URL.** Call the `show_replica { dir: "<abs path to
    .replicate-ui/<app>/" }` MCP tool — it loads `index.html` (assets auto-inlined) +
    `ax_tree.json` into the VibeExtract app's result panel (Preview / HTML / AX Tree
    tabs) and brings the window forward. This is the user-facing preview; do NOT spin up
    `python3 -m http.server` or hand the user a `localhost` URL. (Playwright + a local
    file/server are still fine as YOUR private render target for the `compare_images`
    verify loop — just don't surface a URL as the deliverable.)

11. **Pre-done asset check (REQUIRED — do not skip).** Before you report the replica as done,
    audit the markup: **every icon, avatar, image, and font must be a real harvested asset** (from
    `extract_assets` / the cache) or a pixel-crop of the real element — **zero hand-drawn or
    placeholder assets** (no improvised `<svg><path>`, no initials-in-a-box avatars, no guessed
    glyphs). Re-look at the diff heatmap with the icon/background regions specifically in mind. **Also
    confirm every colour — especially the container/gap background — was sampled from THIS run's
    capture (the fresh crop), not a cached constant or older capture.** The bar is **exact assets and
    exact colours on the first attempt** — the user should never have to tell you an icon, background,
    or colour is wrong. If anything is still approximate, fix it (harvest/crop/re-sample) before
    declaring done.

    **AX-tree deliverables (REQUIRED too):** confirm `.replicate-ui/<app>/ax_tree.json` exists and
    equals the `ax_tree` MCP output, `ax_tree.html` is present, and every node-derived element in
    `index.html` carries `data-ax-*` (built via `markup.el_from_node`). The output is a complete
    semantic spec — visual + structure — not just a picture.

    **You may only say "done" after (a) the runnable ICON GATE (step 8b) is clean — exit 0, or exit 2
    with every EYEBALL tile confirmed by eye — AND (b) the STACKED native-over-replica comparison (step
    8) passes your eye region-by-region.** Never report done while any icon isn't identical to native;
    "diminishing returns" / "SSIM text-capped" / "good enough" are NEVER reasons to ship a wrong icon.
    For native-app replicas, that audit explicitly confirms: every icon came
    from the catalog (or a real crop) and sits at its **measured glyph box**; **chevrons exactly match
    the AX roles** (AXMenuButton only); greyed/disabled states are dimmed; steppers/sub-labels align in
    columns; the Share/accent button uses the **real glyph + sampled colour** (never hand-drawn). The
    bar is that the dev never has to point out a layout, icon, chevron, or colour mistake — catch them
    yourself in the stacked view first.

## vibe-extract tools (reference)
`check_ax_permission`, `request_ax_permission`, `frontmost_app`, `list_windows`,
`ax_tree`, `ax_node_at_point`, `ax_subtree_at_point`, `screenshot_region`,
`screenshot_window`, `sample_color`, `color_palette`, `relaunch_with_debug_port`
(destructive — needs `confirm:true`), `extract_component`, `extract_assets`
(real fonts/icons/images via CDP → local files + manifest), `compare_images`,
`show_replica` (load a finished extraction folder into the app's result panel —
the in-app preview; use instead of serving a URL).

## Notes
- Prefer `ax_tree` node `bounds` → `screenshot_region` for pixel-tight crops over
  `screenshot_window` cropping.
- Mask dynamic content (clocks, unread badges) mentally when reading the score; a
  perfect static replica may still show small red regions there.
- If `compare_images` scores low even on a good replica, re-check you rendered at
  **point** size (not device px) — that's the #1 cause.
