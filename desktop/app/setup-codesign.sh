# Create a stable self-signed code-signing identity in the login keychain and
# then re-sign the dev binary with it. macOS keys Accessibility/Screen-Recording
# permission by the binary's CDHash, which changes on every cargo build (ad-hoc
# signing uses a random UUID). With a stable identity, the CDHash is the same
# across rebuilds and the TCC grant survives.
#
# Run this once. After that, every rebuild followed by `./sign-build.sh` will
# preserve the user's permission grant.
#
# This is the same approach Desktop_Pluck uses (see its setup-codesign.sh /
